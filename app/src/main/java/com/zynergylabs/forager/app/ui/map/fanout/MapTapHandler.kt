 *  - **A fan is open and the tap is on a fanned marker:** that marker's own outcome, as a tap on it would have been (the owner's choice, dispatch
 *    2026-09-28-197), and the fan folds on that same tap (the owner, dispatch 2026-09-28-381: "when an icon gets tapped, immediately display the icon and
 *    dismiss the fan upon that single tap"). The outcome is given where the marker sits in its stack (what the fan folds back to) and with the marker's
 *    own coordinates, not where the finger landed on its displaced copy, so a bubble points at the marker. [onFannedFrom] is told which fan the icon was
 *    picked from, for the way back from a find's page.
 *  - **A fan is open and the tap is anywhere else:** the fan folds, and the tap goes on as it would
 *    have (a plain tap dismisses a bubble, a tap on another marker opens that one). **Except** while a
 *    bubble is showing ([bubbleOpen]) and the tap is on empty map: that tap closes the bubble only and
 *    the fan stays, so the next empty tap folds it (dispatch 2026-09-29-57, item 7, amendment -255). A tap on a fanned icon no longer leaves a bubble
 *    and a fan up together, and a tap on a stack closes a showing bubble as the fan opens (continuation -383); Back from a find's page still brings
 *    the find's bubble and its fan back together, and this exception serves that.
 *  - **The tap resolves to a marker whose touch area overlaps another's** (a stack): the stack
 *    fans out and nothing else is reported (the owner's choice, dispatch 2026-09-28-197).
 *
 * The camera moving folds it unless it is the map following the location ([onCameraMoveStarted]); what the map draws changing, a new style included, folds it only
 * when a member changed ([onContentChanged]).
